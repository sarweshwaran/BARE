Game	:	BARE

About the Game	:
		
	Bare is an fun game which is played by the school students in their free time.
This game is a cinema based puzzle game. 



How to Play 	:
	
	At First you and your friends need to split up into two teams. No.of team memberis not limited. After spliting into two groups one of them going to set the puzzle andanother one going to solve the puzzle. You can discuss and choose who is going set and who is going to solve. After choosing, the puzzle setter needs to discuss with teamets and decied a movie. After deciding, you need fill up the bare box, with first letters of movie name, actor name, actress name, and a song in the movie.

for e.g:
if movie name = "Movie"; actor name = "Actor"; actress name = "Actress"; song = "song song..."

then the bare box will be filled like
				
				BARE box
				  -- --
			movie<-  |M |A |  ->actor
				  -- --
		      actress<-  |A |S |  ->song
				  -- --


NOTE : In my program the puzzle setter need set a temporary password inspite of the song because typing a song may be misspelled. The puzzle setter need to reveal the password only if the opponent find the correct song. But be honest.


Now its solvers time, the solvers need to find the movie name, actor name, actress name, and the song by using the first letters or you can ask upto 2 hints to the puzzle setter. 
But be care you have only four chances. For every wrong answer one letter will be removed from the word BARE if all letter were removed then You will lose the game and puzzle setter will wins the game and Vice verse.

All the Best...
